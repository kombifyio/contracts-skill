# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-11

### Changed

- **Public repository is now a consistent slim distribution**
  - Public CI skips the internal npm/Playwright harness when those dev files are intentionally absent
  - Public README and CONTRIBUTING now describe the slim distribution model instead of the maintainer source repo
  - Public release naming is consistent as `Contracts Skill`

### Fixed

- **Public re-publish behavior** — The OSS publish workflow now force-updates the public release tag so repeated publishes of the same version also refresh the public release pipeline
- **PowerShell installer portability** — Home-directory resolution, relative path handling, temp-directory usage, and generated instruction files now work more reliably across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Bash installer ZIP fallback** — Downloaded archive extraction now falls back to `python3` when `unzip` is unavailable and emits clearer dependency errors
- **UI documentation** — Static UI opening instructions now cover Windows, macOS, and Linux instead of only `open`

## [2.3.0] - 2025-07-12

### Changed

- **Simplified installer** — Reduced from ~2000 to ~350 lines per script
  - 5 agents (Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Codex, Project Local) instead of 8
  - 6 parameters instead of 20+
  - Simple numbered list selection instead of checkbox UI
  - Instruction hooks always injected (no opt-out flag)

### Removed

- `setup.ps1`, `setup.sh` — Redundant auto-installer wrappers
- `installers/bootstrap-install.ps1` — Unnecessary download-and-execute wrapper
- PHP UI (`skill/ui/contracts-ui/`) — Redundant with minimal-ui
- Beads integration in installer
- Cline, Aider, OpenCode agent targets

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Verification Tests (Contract-Level TDD)** — Each contract now defines 1-3 high-leverage tests
  - VTs test the golden path through a module with content-level assertions
  - Chain-Verification Principle: one smart test implicitly validates multiple features
  - Tier-based VT count: core (1), standard (1-2), complex (2-3)
  - All 4 templates (core, feature, integration, utility) include `## Verification Tests` with examples
  - Decision framework and quality gates for choosing effective VTs
  - VT status tracking in CONTRACT.yaml: `defined` | `implemented` | `passing` | `failing`

- **Contract Commitment & Attestation** — Long-term binding across sessions
  - Attestation block in CONTRACT.yaml tracks contract version, VT results, and confidence
  - Confidence scoring: `high` (all VTs passing) / `medium` (some failing) / `low` (not implemented)
  - Re-verification cadence: stale attestations (>30 days) trigger preflight warnings
  - Binding rule: features cannot be marked `implemented` without VT-1 passing
  - Contract changes reset attestation confidence to `low`

### Changed

- **Preflight checks expanded** — Now includes attestation check (Step 4), VT status check (Step 5), and post-implementation attestation update
- **CONTRACT.yaml schema extended** — New `verification_tests` and `attestation` sections
- **CONTRACT.yaml.template updated** — Includes VT and attestation fields out of the box
- **SKILL.md expanded** — All 3 variants now include Contract Commitment and Verification Tests sections
- **Init-contracts workflow** — Step 5b added for VT generation with chain-verification principle, decision framework, and quality gates
- **Preflight summary** — Increased from max 5 to max 7 sentences to include attestation and VT status
- **NEVER/ALWAYS constraints** — Added VT and attestation enforcement rules
- **Sample project updated** — Example contracts include VT sections and attestation fields

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Two-Variant Architecture** — Base and Beads-enforced skills from the same repo
  - `skill/` — Base variant with instruction-based (advisory) enforcement
  - `skill-beads/` — Beads-enforced variant with dependency-blocking preflight tasks
  - Shared scripts, templates, AI analyzer, and UI between variants

- **Beads-Enforced Variant** (`skill-beads/`)
  - `SKILL.md` with Beads prerequisites and enforced preflight workflow
  - `contract-preflight.md` with Beads task lifecycle (`bd create`, `bd close`)
  - `init-contracts.md` with Beads setup and standing preflight task creation

- **Hash Recovery** — New section in both SKILL.md variants for recovering from corrupted `source_hash`

- **Meta-Contracts Suggestions** — Init agent now suggests project-level contracts

### Changed

- **All UI text translated to English** — Replaced German strings in `index.php`, `minimal-ui/README.md`, `contracts-ui/README.md`
- **YAML parsing improved** — Line-anchored regex for key detection, multi-quote support for hash extraction in `validate-contracts.ps1` and `contract-preflight.ps1`
- **UI startup logic simplified** — `Start-UiIfAvailable` in `init-contracts.ps1` reduced from ~87 to ~40 lines
- **README.md rewritten** — Documents both variants with comparison tables
- **skill/README.md updated** — Reflects current structure and cross-references Beads variant
- **CONTRIBUTING.md updated** — Current project structure and automated test instructions

### Fixed

- **Interactive Installer** — Enter key confirmation loop fixed
- **Agent Instructions** — Reduced from 5-13 lines to 1 line each

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added

- **AI-Assisted Initialization** - Complete rewrite of the initialization system
  - New `analyzer.js` module performs semantic code analysis
  - Detects project type (Node.js, Python, Go, Rust) automatically
  - Analyzes source structure, exports, and complexity metrics
  - Generates intelligent contract recommendations with reasoning
  - Scores modules by importance (exports, test coverage, dependencies)
  
- **Multi-Agent Installer with Selection**
  - All installers now support agent selection
  - Interactive mode: choose which agents to install to
  - Auto mode: install to all detected agents
  - Specific agents: `--agents copilot,claude,cursor`
  - Supports: GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, Cline, and local project

- **New Templates**
  - `integration.md` - For external API integrations
  - `utility.md` - For helper/utility modules

### Changed

- **Initialization is now AI-assisted instead of pattern-based**
  - Old: Fixed patterns (`src/features/*`, `src/core/*`)
  - New: Semantic analysis of codebase
  - Old: Simple templates
  - New: Context-aware drafts from actual code exports

- **Updated Documentation**
  - `initialization.md` - Complete rewrite for AI-assisted workflow
  - `assistant-hooks/init-contracts.md` - New implementation guide
  - `SKILL.md` - Updated initialization section

### Fixed

- Agent selection now works in all installer variants
