# Contract Initialization (AI-Assisted)

**Trigger phrases:** "init contracts", "initialize contracts", "set up contracts", "analyze my project for contracts"

---

## Quick Start

1. Verify skill is installed (look for `SKILL.md` in skill directory)
2. Run semantic analysis on the project
3. Present recommendations with reasoning
4. Generate drafts for user review
5. Create files ONLY after explicit user approval

```bash
# CLI alternative
node .github/skills/contracts/ai/init-agent/index.js --path . --analyze
node .github/skills/contracts/ai/init-agent/index.js --path . --apply --yes
```

---

## The Initialization Flow

### Step 1: Project Discovery

Detect project type from config files (package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml).
Scan source directories (src/, lib/, app/). Map module boundaries.

### Step 2: Semantic Module Analysis

For each potential module, evaluate:
- **Code volume**: lines, file count → module importance
- **Complexity**: subdirectory depth → tier assignment
- **Public API**: exports, entry points → feature extraction
- **Test coverage**: test file presence → maturity signal
- **Relationships**: import patterns → dependency mapping

### Step 3: Score and Recommend

```javascript
score = (lineCount / 10) + (subDirCount * 5) + (hasEntryPoint ? 10 : 0)
      + (hasTests ? 10 : 0) + (exportCount * 2) + (isCoreType ? 20 : 0)
```

| Tier | Criteria | CONTRACT.md Limit |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| core | < 100 lines, ≤ 1 subdirectory | 30 lines |
| standard | 100-500 lines, 2-3 subdirectories | 50 lines |
| complex | > 500 lines, > 3 subdirectories | 80 lines |

Module type by path: core/ → core, features/ → feature, integration/ → integration, util/ → utility.

### Step 4: Present Recommendations

Show user a table with module name, type, tier, reason (why this module needs a contract).
Ask: "Generate drafts for all, select specific, add unlisted, or skip?"

### Step 5: Generate and Review Drafts

For each approved module:
1. Use appropriate template (core/feature/integration/utility)
2. Fill Purpose from code analysis (NOT just listing exports — describe the user problem)
3. Fill Features from detected exports, map to test files
4. Generate testable Success Criteria (Given/When/Then, not "works correctly")
5. **Generate Verification Tests** (see Step 5b below)
6. Mark as `<!-- DRAFT: Review and modify, then remove this line -->`
7. Present draft to user for approval before creating files

### Step 5b: Generate Verification Tests

This is the most critical step. VTs are what make contracts enforceable long-term.

**The Process:**
1. **Understand the module's golden path**: What does a real user DO with this module? What is the first and most important action?
2. **Trace the chain**: What components/features MUST work for that action to succeed? List them.
3. **Find the content assertion**: What concrete output can be checked to prove it all worked? Not "no error" — actual text, value, or state.
4. **Write the VT**: Scenario → Action → Verify → Proves

**The Chain-Verification Principle:**
A good VT is like pulling a thread — if ANY link in the chain is broken, the test fails. This is how one test covers many features:

```
User action → Feature A → Feature B → Feature C → Observable output
                 ↓            ↓            ↓            ↓
              If broken,   If broken,   If broken,   We check THIS
              test fails   test fails   test fails   specific value
```

**Decision Framework for Choosing VTs:**

| Question | Answer guides VT design |
|----------|------------------------|
| What does a user do FIRST with this module? | → VT-1 scenario |
| What output proves it actually WORKED? | → VT-1 verify assertion |
| What is the longest chain of features needed for that? | → VT-1 proves list |
| What is the most dangerous failure mode? | → VT-2 scenario (if tier allows) |
| What secondary path do power users rely on? | → VT-3 scenario (complex tier only) |

**Concrete Examples by Module Type:**

| Module Type | VT Scenario | Verify Assertion | Implicitly Tests |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Chat Agent | Send question, check answer text | Response contains factual answer | Auth, session, UI, API, LLM, rendering |
| Auth Module | Create user → login → use token | Token decodes to correct user ID | Hashing, storage, login, token gen, validation |
| Payment API | Charge $1 in sandbox | Transaction ID matches `txn_[a-z0-9]+` | Auth, formatting, API call, response parsing |
| Dashboard | Login → load dashboard | Widget shows correct user name | Auth, data fetch, component render, state mgmt |
| File Upload | Upload PNG → download it | Downloaded file hash equals original | Upload, storage, retrieval, integrity |
| Search | Index doc → search for keyword | Result contains the indexed document title | Indexing, query parsing, ranking, result display |
| Email Service | Send test email → check inbox | Received subject matches sent subject | SMTP config, template, send pipeline, delivery |

**Quality Gate for Generated VTs:**

| Gate | Pass | Fail |
|------|------|------|
| **Content assertion** | Checks specific text, value, or state | Checks "not null", "status 200", "no error" |
| **Chain coverage** | Proves list includes 3+ features | Only tests one isolated function |
| **Realistic scenario** | Uses real-world user action | Uses artificial/trivial test data |
| **Failure sensitivity** | Would fail if ANY core feature breaks | Only fails for one specific bug |
| **Specificity** | Exact expected value defined | Vague "works correctly" |

### Step 6: Create Files

After explicit approval:
1. Create CONTRACT.md files (marked DRAFT)
2. Create CONTRACT.yaml files with computed hashes
3. Create/update `.contracts/registry.yaml`
4. Present summary with next steps

## Quality Gates for Generated Contracts

A good contract draft must pass these checks:

| Gate | Pass | Fail |
|------|------|------|
| **Purpose** | Describes user problem solved | Just lists exports or function names |
| **Features** | Each maps to a test file (or "TODO") | No test mapping |
| **Constraints** | Testable, measurable MUST/MUST NOT | Vague ("handle errors gracefully") |
| **Success Criteria** | Given/When/Then or specific metric | "Module works correctly" |
| **Verification Tests** | Content assertion on golden-path output | "No errors", "status 200", or missing entirely |

### Good vs Bad Examples

**Purpose — GOOD:**
> Manages user authentication state to enable secure access across the application. Handles login, session persistence, and token refresh.

**Purpose — BAD:**
> Provides login, logout, validateSession, refreshToken functions.

**Success Criteria — GOOD:**
> - Given valid credentials, when login() is called, then returns session token within 200ms
> - Given expired token, when validateSession() is called, then returns false and triggers refresh

**Success Criteria — BAD:**
> - Module functions as expected and integrates with the rest of the application.
> - All tests pass.

**Constraints — GOOD:**
> - MUST: Hash passwords with bcrypt (min 12 rounds)
> - MUST NOT: Store plain-text passwords in any storage layer

**Constraints — BAD:**
> - MUST: Follow project coding standards
> - MUST: Have comprehensive test coverage

**Verification Test — GOOD:**
> **VT-1: Chat produces verified factual response**
> - Do: Login → open chat → send "What is the capital of France?"
> - Assert: Response text contains "Paris"

**Verification Test — BAD:**
> **VT-1: Chat works**
> - Do: Send message to chat
> - Assert: Response is not empty

*Why it's bad: "Not empty" proves nothing — an error message is also "not empty". No chain coverage. No content verification.*

## Handling Special Cases

### Monorepos
Analyze from root. Present packages as top-level modules. Offer to drill into specific packages.

### Existing Contracts
Report existing contracts. Only recommend new ones for uncovered modules.

### Non-Standard Structures
Fall back to complexity-based detection. Show top candidates by line count. Let user specify directories.

### Meta-Contracts (Optional)
For project-wide standards (testing policy, deployment, dev workflow), suggest meta-contracts in `.contracts/`.

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| No modules detected | Offer manual directory selection or single project-wide contract |
| analyzer.js not found | Guide user to reinstall skill |
| Permission errors | Continue with accessible files, note skipped directories |
| Existing contracts found | Show existing, recommend only gaps |

## Post-Initialization Next Steps

1. Review each CONTRACT.md — remove `<!-- DRAFT -->` when satisfied
2. Adjust features, constraints, success criteria
3. **Review Verification Tests critically** — ask for each VT:
   - "If this test passes, am I confident the module works?" → if not, strengthen the assertion
   - "Does the Verify check actual content or just existence?" → content is mandatory
   - "How many features would break this test?" → aim for 3+ (chain coverage)
4. Use "check contracts" to verify sync status
5. Use "contract preflight" before implementing features
6. **Implement VT-1 for each contract** as the first development step — this establishes the baseline
7. Attestation is initialized automatically after first VT pass
